      <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
      <h2>Empowering equity for all</h2>
      <p>
        We are a registered non-profit organization, proudly sponsored by the Open Collective
        Foundation since June 2023. Our journey began with dedicated students passionate about
        healthcare equity, volunteering at underserved medical outreach sites. Recognizing the
        limitations of existing paper medical record systems for these communities, we gathered a
        talented team to develop a free electronic medical record (EMR) system specifically for
        medical outreach.

      <p>
        Currently, we are partnering with Street Corner Care, actively testing our front-end system
        as we work towards our mission of providing tailored healthcare solutions to underserved
        populations. Heal in Pocket is founded on the belief that we all have a responsibility to
        make a meaningful impact in our community.
